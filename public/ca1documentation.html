            <p>We used Wireshark to sniff all the TCP packets, which was send and received on our client.
                There is no connection between our Client and our server when we start the Client so we can expect to
                see a Three Way Handshake among the first three packets, when we attempt to connect.
                First we connected to the server using the CONNECT# command in our client. It was easy to see the packet
                send and the expected (Online#) packet received.
                When another user logged in, our Client again received the packet containing the ONLINE# command along
                with the list of online users.
                We also tested the SEND# command, by sending a message both from and to our Client and received the
                expected answer from our Server.
                Upon closing our Chat Client the CLOSE# command was send to our Server, which send back a CLOSE# command
                after which a graceful shutdown was done.
                The last packets received contains the expected FIN ACK packets.</p>

            <h4>Client</h4>

            <p>
                In the client application, every class has its own interface. An observer pattern has been
                implemented
                in
                the
                GUI class and clientSide class, which calls for an interface solution. This makes it possible, not
                having
                the
                Swing interface “blocked”, while waiting for a response(in this case a message) from the server.

                Originally, the program only had one interface: ”ViewListener”, which was implemented in the GUI. We
                then
                added
                the SocketClass, which contains the thread that listens for inputs from the server. We thought the
                best
                way
                to
                tell ClientSide that a new message had arrived, was to contain it as an observer of SocketClass.
                That
                way,
                we
                can do it, without SocketClass knowing anything about ClientSide class.

                The SocketClass also implements an interface: “SocketIF”. This way, it’s easier to use another
                connector
                class
                in the program, thous it implements the SocketIF interface. This also makes it easier to set op a
                mock.

        <div class="panel-body">
            <h4>Server</h4>

            <p>
                The ServerSide project gets started from the class ServerExecutor. This class starts both the
                ChatServer
                and
                the
                WebServer.

                Overall we’ve tried to create a layer of abstraction by making interfaces. This also makes it easier
                for
                us
                to
                test(making mockups). We’ve tried to aim for high testability in all our classes, hence it has a lot
                of
                responsibilities.

                The server logs to a file, using a FileHandler. This way, we can log everything that happens on the
                server.
