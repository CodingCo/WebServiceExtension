                This CA builds upon the project from CA1, so we’ll be able to host the website, run the chatServer(CA1)
                and offer the new REST-services we’ve been making in this CA.

            <p>
                We’ve created a JUnit test of the class PersonFacade. This is relevant for the assignment, because this
                class handles all JPA calls, which persists data on the database. Because of the importance of this
                class, we wanted a well written test that verifies the functionality. We’re testing both on a mock(a
                class that “acts as a database”), which uses its own collection to to store data, and a test
                database(PersonFacadeDB).
                The class PersonFacade is used to persist data on the database using JPA. It acts like a “facade”,
                because the class is the link between the application and the database(Like we made facade classes in
                2.sem project, to call each layer functionality). We use PersonFacade every time we want to deal with
                info about a person.
                Note that all our entities is placed under the model package. We use JPA to map our entity classes to
                our database. Our approach was to create the classes in java first, and then use JPA to generate all the
                tables on the database, based on the annotations on each entity class.
                We use only the PersonHandler class for handling the database calls for Person and the Roleschool
                objects. Since there is only one method related to RoleSchool, we decided to include it in the
                PersonHandler class.

        <!-- TEST-->
        <div class="panel-body">
            <h3>Test</h3>

            <p>
                We added an additional test-package to our Test Packages folder named “facadeTests”.
                It consist of the following java-classes; “PersonFacadeDB”, “PersonFacadeMock”, “RoleSchoolAdapter” and
                the crucial testfile “PersonFacadeTest”.
            </p>

            <p>
                We created a JUnit test that should test our facade class. First we wanted to test up against a class,
                that did not need a physical database. Therefore we wanted to make use of Mocking, and created
                the “PersonFacadeMock” and the “PersonFacadeDB”, both implementing an interface named “IPersonFacade”.
                This secures, that both facade-classes should contain some specific methods, that are stated in the
                interface.
            </p>

            <p>
                When unit-testing, we created our file “PersonFacadeTest”, that has a test-method for each method
                located in the interface, and that makes the testfile capable of testing the same behavior on
                “PersonFacadeMock” and the “PersonFacadeDB”.
                The “PersonFacadeMock” works up against a collection of persons, that is a replacement of the database
                we are going to use in the final version, but the behavior is exactly the same whether we are testing up
                against a collection of persons or a DB with the necessary tables.
                In the final version we should use our “PersonFacadeDB”, that uses JPA to manipulate with entities
                inside our DB.
            </p>

            <p>

                It is a good habit, when developing programs that are dependent on a database, to test up against a
                Mock-database at first, which we earlier stated only is a collection.
                This test-class should be adaptable to test up against both facades, so we can avoid to create two
                almost identical test-classes, one for each facade.
                When the result of the tests on our Mock is 100% error-free, we can start to develop our real facade,
                that is working with the DB and test it later on with the exact same testmethods.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because we let the two facades implement the same interface, it was possible to test up against our mock
                and our real database. Inside our test-class we created a method with the @Before annotation, which
                ensures, that everything inside the body is executed BEFORE every single test-method.
                This method contains a new instantiation of the specific Facade we are creating, so every test-method is
                working with a an empty collection or DB.
                The collection is instantiated in the constructor of “PersonFacadeMock” and an entitymanager is
                instantiated in the constructor of “PersonFacadeDB”, that works with our persistence.xml, with the
                “drop-and-create” Table Generation Strategy. This strategy empties the tables we are working with in the
                DB.

            <h3>inheritance</h3>

            <p>
                We have multiple strategies to choose from, when we want to map an inheritance solution from the OO
                world, to the relational world using JPA: JOINED, TABLE_PER_CLASS or SINGLE_TABLE.
            </p>

            <p>
                The abstract class RoleSchool, has three subclasses: Teacher, Student and AssistentTeacher. The super
                class RoleSchool(which is the highest class in the hiarchy) must be mapped with an inheritance strategy,
                if none is defined, JPA uses InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE as default strategy.
            </p>

            <p>
                The assignment required us to choose from either single table or joined. We ended up with the single
                table strategy. We did this because it’s simple to understand, and a faster solution, if the database
                gets many queries(comparing this to the alternative join strategy). The simplicity is of course the fact
                that we only have one table, and because of the attribute DTYPE. This attribute is the
                “discriminator”-value, which descriminates each tuple from each other, telling us what every tuple is;
                Student, Teacher or AssistentTeacher.
            </p>

            <p>
                As mentioned above, the single table strategy is faster than joined, which is one of the reason we
                didn’t choose joined. Unlike the single strategy, the joined solution creates multiple join operations,
                if we query data that covers more than one class of the class hierarchy. If we chose join, the database
                would have a table for every single entity, containing data specific for that subclass. A table would
                also be generated for the super class. This is also why this solution is considered a bit more
                “OO-friendly”.
